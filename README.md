# CastMate

CastMate is an all-in-one Broadcaster Production Suite for Twitch. It lets a streamer create viewer interactions, automate common tasks, display overlays, and plan streams.

## Triggers

In CastMate you can setup triggers to respond to twitch events like channel point redemptions, bits being cheered, gaining a follower, receiving a sub, chat messages, being raided, hype trains, and more.

You can use actions to automatically respond to triggers. Using CastMate's click and drag timeline automation system you can easily setup sounds to play, lights to change, chat to twitch, message to discord, etc. Using triggers lets you easily create an interactive stream for your audience.

## Profiles

A Profile is an organizational tool to group triggers together. They also serve as a way to change what triggers are active. Profiles can be manually turned on and off, or they can be set to automatically turn on and off based custom conditions you choose.

When a profile is off it will automatically disable the channel point rewards no longer needed, any chat commands in it will become unavailable, and

## Overlays

CastMate has a WYSIWYG interface for creating overlays. Create custom alerts entirely though the UI. Sync labels with CastMate's internal state automatically. Easily edit your overlays right in the UI and have their results appear immediately once saved in OBS.

## SpellCast

SpellCast is a companion twitch extension to CastMate that lets you do away with your "bits menu". SpellCast lets you create custom spells your viewers can cast for bits to trigger CastMate. They are activated and deactivated with your profiles just like channel point rewards. This way it's always clear to your viewers what bits will do on your stream.
